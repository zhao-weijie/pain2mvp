- Example: "What are OpenClaw users frustrated by?" or "What are Harvey users complaining about?"
- Features sqlite-vec enabled semantic clustering and deduplication over collected pain points.
- PRD mode: ask for a PRD from a persisted opportunity id or latest high-confidence result.
- Example: "Generate a PRD from opportunity `opp_20260328_01`."
